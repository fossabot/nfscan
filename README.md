NFScan is a free, open-source software, available to non-profit organizations to receive donations effectively.

## What's new in this version

* Create Cloudformation templates to allow easy deploy by anyone with an AWS account.
* Access AWS resources using IAM roles instead of hardcoded accessKeys and secretKeys.
* Remove references to BasicCredentials since we're gonna use AWSCredentialsChain for that.
* Parameterize backend username and password.
* Upgrade AWS sdk to 1.11.44.

## Quickly deploy nfscan to AWS

The easiest way to deploy nfscan to AWS is through the use of a [Cloudformation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) template. It allows the required infrastructure and dependent services to be provisioned with little to none knowledge of AWS. 

The table below shows different regions where you want to deploy nfscan. There are numerous factors that you could take into consideration when deciding which one you're going to launch it. However, if your primary concern is about how much it's gonna cost then either N. Virgina and Ohio will be a good call. If low latency is a requirement, then São Paulo will be a better option.

## Setting up development environment

Walkthrough in [Portuguese](https://github.com/nfscan/nfscan/wiki/Develpment-environment---%5BPortuguese%5D)

## Public API

Once you've set up your development enviroment you can make calls to nfscan's public API to process or donate receipts. We've created [a wiki page](https://github.com/nfscan/nfscan/wiki/Public-API-calls-%5BPortuguese%5D) containing all requests you should use in order to integrate with whatever app/site of yours.

## Mobile

We've made an open source app for [iOS](https://github.com/nfscan/ios-receipt-scan-example) that integrates with nfscan. You may use it as a reference model or even as a white label product. That's up to you.
